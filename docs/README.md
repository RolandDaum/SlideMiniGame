A simple game where you have to slide left and right by tapping the screen to avoid the white blocks falling down and score points by collecting the green ones. If you want to play it click [here](https://rolanddaum.github.io/SlideMiniGame/) or go on https://rolanddaum.github.io/SlideMiniGame/.

The original game idea came from [this](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/E-gfTKab6Tk) YT-Shorts video. I just adopted like everything I saw in the video and remade it. Props to the guy who made the video.

## Code

It all runs with plain JavaScript with a little of HTML and CSS. As much, as I can remember since doing this almost a year ago is, that the cubes are falling in a linear function calculated path. If you want to know anything else about the game engine/mechanic, feel free to have a look inside the [/game.js](/game.js) file. Most functions are commented, so it's hopefully fairly easy to understand.
